#02 QUESTION
#static variable and access that through a instance

When we declare a variable inside a class, but outside the method, it is called a static or class variable. It can be called directly from a class but not through the instances of a class.


#03 QUESTION
#static variable and change within the instance

Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables or the this reference (since there is no calling object for them), and static methods cannot call non-static methods. However, non-static methods have access to all variables (instance or static) and methods (static or non-static) in the class.


#04 QUESTION
#Define a static variable and change within the class

Static methods are associated with the class, not objects of the class.Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables, but they can access or change the values of static variables.
